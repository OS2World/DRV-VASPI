@Virtual ASPI driver for OS/2 2.x
(C) 1994 ARS Computer und Consulting GmbH


This is an evaluation version. The restrictions compared to the full
version are:

- Only the first started DOS session will have ASPI available. No
  further DOS session (even after the first one terminated) will have
  ASPI available.

- The ASPI in the first started DOS session will stop functioning
  after 15 minutes.

- To get access to ASPI in a DOS session again, you will have to
  reboot the system.

- Questions will ONLY be answered via CompuServe, FAX messages and
  phone calls will not be handled.


To get the full version:

Only if you are in Europe, you can send an order (via FAX, for
example) and will receive the full version via postal mail. The price
in this case is DM 98.-- plus DM 8.-- shipping costs.

In any case (worldwide) you can register your copy via CompuServe's
ShareWare registration service (GO SWREG), the registration ID is
2510, the title is "Virtual ASPI Driver 1.3 for OS/2". 

In this case, you will receive the full version via CompuServe mail
(and no shipping costs apply). The price is $59 and will be charged to
your CompuServe bill. If you want to get it sent via postal mail
instead (please specify), shipping costs are $10.
