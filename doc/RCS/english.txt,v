:h2 res=2001.Overview
:p.OS/2 2.x contains a driver architecture for SCSI host adaptors and
peripheral devices. It consists of a host adaptor specific driver
(ADD) and, based on this, device managers (DMD) which are either
specific for common classes of devices (hard disks, CD-ROM drives) or
which provide a universal interface for additional application
specific device drivers.

:p.One of these universal device managers in OS/2 2.x implements
Adaptec's ASPI programming interface for OS/2. ASPI (Advanced SCSI
Programming Interface) allows development of applications, which can
communicate with peripheral devices, independent of the actual SCSI
host adaptor. ASPI definitions exist for DOS, Windows, OS/2 and Novell
NetWare 3.x and 4.x servers.

:p.The ASPI programming interface in OS/2 2.x resides in the base device
manager OS2ASPI.DMD (please refer to the OS/2 online documentation for
more information about it). In this implementation, it supports only
OS/2 device drivers which build upon the ASPI interface. Neither can
OS/2 applications nor can DOS and Windows applications running under
OS/2 2.x access the ASPI interface of OS/2 2.x directly.

:p.Since many existing DOS and Windows applications use ASPI to
communicate with SCSI devices (for example, backup software for SCSI
tape devices or image scanning software for SCSI scanners), such
applications could not be used under OS/2 2.x so far.

:p.The included virtual ASPI driver (VASPI) for OS/2 2.x implements an
ASPI interface for DOS and Windows applications running in DOS and
WIN-OS/2 sessions under OS/2 2.x. Both the ASPI definition for DOS and
the ASPI definition for Windows are implemented. In addition the
driver contains an ASPI interface for OS/2 applications, since they
can otherwise not directly access the OS/2 ASPI and would thus need
their own device drivers for this purpose.

:h2 res=2002.Installation
:p.The virtual ASPI driver consists of four drivers modules:
:ol.
:li.the physical VASPI driver which connects to the OS/2 ASPI driver
(which is installed with BASEDEV=OS2ASPI.DMD), this module is named
VASPIDD.SYS,
:li.the virtual VASPI driver which implements the ASPI definition for
DOS sessions, named VASPI.SYS,
:li.the stub device driver for specific DOS sessions (booted from
a DOS floppy or image file under OS/2), VASPISTB.SYS and
:li.the Windows DLL which implements the ASPI definition for Windows,
named WINASPI.DLL.
:eol.
:p.For automatic installation, a device driver profile is included.
Use the "Device Driver Install" object in the "System Setup" folder to
install the VASPI driver. This procedure also takes care to add the
reference to the OS/2 ASPI driver (OS2ASPI.DMD) to your CONFIG.SYS, if
necessary. However, this installation method assumes that the base
device driver for your SCSI host adaptor is already installed (see
below for more information). Please also read the text below on
trouble shooting. After installation is completed, you have to reboot
your system for the changes to take effect.

:p.For manual installation, the two core device drivers are loaded in
CONFIG.SYS as follows (we suggest copying both drivers into the \OS2
and \OS2\MDOS directories on your system boot drive):
:xmp.
  DEVICE=C&colon.\OS2\VASPIDD.SYS
  DEVICE=C&colon.\OS2\MDOS\VASPI.SYS
:exmp.
:p.If you install the drivers on another drive or directory or your
system boots from a different drive than C&colon., please correct the two
lines as needed.

:p.In addition to the VASPI drivers there must also two additional
drivers always be loaded: the base device driver for the SCSI host
adaptor (with extension .ADD) and the OS/2 ASPI driver (OS2ASPI.DMD).
A number of host adaptors is directly supported by OS/2 and for many
other host adaptors there are OS/2 drivers (.ADD) available from the
manufacturer. For the Adaptec AHA-1542 host adaptor, which is directly
supported by OS/2, the following drivers are to be loaded in
CONFIG.SYS, for example:
:xmp.
  BASEDEV=AHA154X.ADD /V
  BASEDEV=OS2ASPI.DMD
:exmp.
:p.For other host adaptors AHA154X.ADD has to be replaced by the
appropriate driver. More details about OS2ASPI.DMD, the ADD
drivers included with OS/2 and their options are available in the OS/2
(online) documentation under the topic BASEDEV.

:p.The exact position of the two lines loading VASPIDD.SYS and
VASPI.SYS in CONFIG.SYS is not significant, but we suggest putting
them directly after the BASEDEV=OS2ASPI.DMD line.

:p.The Windows DLL (WINASPI.DLL) must be copied into the WIN-OS/2 system
directory, usually C&colon.\OS2\MDOS\WINOS2\SYSTEM, or, in the case of
OS/2 for Windows, C&colon.\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.

:p.The stub device driver VASPISTB.SYS should be copied to
C&colon.\OS2\MDOS. It will only be needed if a real (original) DOS
version is started under OS/2 from a DOS floppy or a floppy image and
ASPI is needed. In this case, VASPISTB.SYS must be loaded in the
CONFIG.SYS of that DOS session (and not in the OS/2 CONFIG.SYS).

:p.With these steps, the installation is completed, but you have to
restart (reboot) your system to make the changes active.

:p.Please ensure that during boot of your system all SCSI peripherals are
correctly connected to the compuer and are also turned on. The OS/2
drivers for most SCSI host adaptore and the OS/2 ASPI device manager
check at load time, if there are devices to manage at all. If that is
not the case, these drivers perhaps don't even load.

:p.Please check also, if the SCSI bus termination is installed correctly.
A common error is that both internal and external devices are
connected to the SCSI host adaptor but the termination on the host
adaptor itself was not removed (the SCSI bus must be terminated only
on both ends). In such cases some or all connected devices may not be
detected and data transfer errors can occur. The termination on the
host adaptor is usually configured with jumpers, DIP switches,
removable resistor packs or even via software.

:p.To determine if and which devices are recognized by the host adaptor
(if that feature is not already provided by your host adaptors BIOS
during the power on self test) you can add the /V option to your host
adaptors BASEDEV driver in CONFIG.SYS. Most OS/2 ADD drivers recognize
this option and respond by displaying version numbers, perhaps
hardware revisions and most often a list of found SCSI devices.

:p.If all drivers load correctly, you can finally use the included test
programs (see below) to retrieve a list of available devices for ASPI
applications. This list will often be shorter that the ADD drivers
list, because some devices may already be in use by other device
managers and are thus not available to the ASPI manager.

:h2 res=2003.DOS Settings
:p.After you have installed the driver(s) correctly and have restarted
your system, you will find a new entry in the DOS settings of DOS
program objects, ASPI_ENABLE. This parameter defines, if ASPI is
available in the session started from this object. The default is OFF,
i.e. the ASPI interface is NOT available. Please change this parameter
for all those program objects which you use to start your (DOS and
WIN-OS/2) ASPI applications to ON.

:p.The default (OFF) can be changed globally to ON by adding the
option /ON to the line DEVICE=C&colon.\OS2\MDOS\VASPI.SYS in your
CONFIG.SYS. In this case all DOS and WIN-OS/2 sessions have ASPI
available automatically, but you can still disable ASPI for each
program object individually.

:h2 res=2004.Programmer's API
:p.If you want to develop own DOS or Windows applications for ASPI, you
can use the documentation and sample code available from Adaptec. If
you want to develop OS/2 ASPI applications but want to avoid writing
your own device driver interfacing with OS/2's ASPI manager, you can
use the API included in VASPIDD.SYS.

:p.You can find sample DOS and OS/2 ASPI applications in the \SAMPLES
directory in the distribution of this driver. It contains the source
code for the DOS and OS/2 test programs for ASPI (as mentioned below)
and a C header file with the ASPI definitions for DOS and OS/2 ASPI
applications.

:p.The DOS test program can be compiled with Microsoft C, version 6.00 or
newer. For other compilers, changes are required because inline
assembly language statements are used for access to the DOS ASPI
interface. This sample program does of course also work under plain
DOS with standard ASPI drivers.

:p.The OS/2 test program can be compiled as 16-bit application with
Microsoft C, version 6.00 or Watcom C/C++ 16, version 9.5 or higher.
To generate a 32-bit version, IBM C Set++, Watcom C/C++ 32, version
9.5 or higher or the GNU C compiler can be used. For other compilers
only minimal changes should be required, since the standard I/O
control interface is used for access to VASPIDD.SYS.

:p.This API for OS/2 ASPI applications knows a "posting" and a "non-
posting" mode, just like the DOS and Windows versions (see Adaptec
ASPI documentation for an explanation what posting means). However,
because of the proteced architecture of OS/2, postimg mode is only
possible for device drivers interfacing directly with the OS/2 ASPI
manager. SCSI requests via the API in VASPIDD.SYS are always processed
in posting mode, but the post routine is contained in this driver and
there is no way to define a post routine in the calling application.
That means that a request via this API does only return to the calling
application when it was completely processed, the application will be
blocked until this is the case. However, this blocking only affects
the calling thread. If the application has to do other work during
this time, it must be multithreaded.

:p.Posting for DOS and Windows ASPI applications works, it is simulated
by the virtual ASPI driver, because existing DOS and Windows
applications use that feature.

:p.There can be more than one application or thread accessing the API at
a time, the VASPIDD.SYS driver is reentrant.

:h2 res=2005.Test Programs
:p.In the distribution there are two test programs, ASPI.EXE (a DOS
application) and ASPI2.EXE (an OS/2 application), that can be used for
diagnostic purposes. They are sample programs too (see above) and
their source code is included.

:p.Both programs, DOS and OS/2 version, use ASPI to list all SCSI host
adaptors in the system and all SCSI peripheral devices connected to
them, as long as they are not yet in use by other device managers (as
it is the case with hard disks and CD-ROM drives). For all devices
found the device type, vendor name and device name are listed.

:h2 res=2006.Compatibility
:p.The following DOS and Windows applications were testes successfully
for compatibility:
:ol.
:li.SCSI tape backup software (with a Tandberg TDC-4100 streamer)
:ul compact.

This OS/2 software cann access a DOS HP scanner device driver via a
auxiliary program in a DOS session.

:li.Agfa FotoLook, version 1.26E, scanner: Agfa Arcus Plus
:li.egsSoft Keyfile ScanServer, Scanner: Fujitsu M3096G
:eul.
:eol.
:p.The HP DeskScan and Agfa FotoLook applications also provide a TWAIN
interface for Windows applications and let thus other Windows
applications access the scanner if they support TWAIN, for example,
Adobe PhotoStyler, Picture Publisher or Corel PhotoPain (part of Corel
Draw 4.0 for Windows).

:p.If you use other software with this VASPI driver which is not listed
here, please send us a short notice to allow us adding it to this
compatibility list.

:h2 res=2007.Known Problems
:ul.
:li.If the ASPI interface is turned off for a DOS session (via the DOS
settings), some ASPI compatible software may still detect the
availability of an ASPI interface. However, all further ASPI
requests will fail in any case.

:li.If you run Windows ASPI applications in fullscreen WIN-OS/2
sessions, it is normal if during processing of SCSI requests which
take rather long to complete (tape rewinding, for example) the mouse
pointer cannot be moved. This is caused by the fact that the session
is blocked in the ASPI driver during this time.

:li.The Centrol Point backup programs in the DOS (8.0, 9.0) and Windows
(2.0) versions of the PC-TOOLS packages do not work reliably with
this VASPI driver. While these programs can access SCSI tape
devices, they may crash at random occasions, causing the affected
DOS or WIN-OS/2 session to be terminated.
:eul.

:h2 res=2008.Test/Problem Reports
:p.If you should have problems using an ASPI compatible DOS or Windows
software with this VASPI driver, please send a report with the
following items included:
:ul compact.
:li.version and serial number of the VASPI driver
:li.exact type, name, version and vendor of the affected software
:li.type and manufacturer of the SCSI peripheral device
